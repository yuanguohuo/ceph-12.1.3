qa/standalone
=============

These scripts run standalone clusters, but not in a normal way.  They make
use of functions ceph-helpers.sh to quickly start/stop daemons against
toy clusters in a single directory.

They are normally run via teuthology based on qa/suites/rados/standalone/*.yaml.

You can run them in a git checkout + build directory as well:

  * The qa/run-standalone.sh will run all of them in sequence.  This is slow
     since there is no parallelism.

  * You can run an individual script by passing these environment args.  For
    example, if you are in the build/ directory,

PATH=$PATH:bin CEPH_ROOT=.. CEPH_LIB=lib ../qa/standalone/mon/misc.sh
